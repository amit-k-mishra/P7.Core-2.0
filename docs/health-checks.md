# Health Checks

[asp.net core HealthChecks](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/HealthChecks)

## Temporary
At the moment HealthChecks has not yet been built using asp.net core 2.0. As soon as the dotnet team does this build, a copy of it is built here using asp.net core 2.0.  
[P7.AspNetCore.HealthChecks](../src/P7.AspNetCore.HealthChecks)  
[P7.Extensions.HealthChecks](../src/P7.Extensions.HealthChecks)
## Goal
Make it all configurable.
Currently this is done using the following;  
[appsettings](../src/WebApplication1/appsettings-healthcheck.json)
